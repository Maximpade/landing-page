        Max is FABULOUS! He went above and beyond on our car deal. We were looking at two cars, he was knowledgeable on both cars, compared Pros and Cons with both and in his spare time did the research. He listens to his customers concerns, wants, etc. and provides the best car based on his customer. Because of Max, best all time car buying experience I have ever had and Iâ€™m 60 years old! Go see Max and let him earn your business! He definitely earned mine!</p>
